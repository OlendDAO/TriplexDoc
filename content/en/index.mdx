# Triplex

Triplex is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol built on Aptos and other compatible chains, offering a modular architecture and flexible liquidity provision system. It introduces an innovative DeFi framework that addresses challenges faced by traditional on-chain derivatives platforms, such as liquidity acquisition and infrastructure scaling.

With Triplex, users can experience more efficient capital utilization, more flexible risk exposure, and a new level of interoperability.
